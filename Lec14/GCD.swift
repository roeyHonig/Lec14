// get a ref to the main Thread
// very important to know this line!!!!!

// we should the following but know that ios is so so nice that it doesn't truss us to instintiate or manually use them

// fifo = serial queue
let serialQ = DispatchQueue(label: "MySerialQ") // a custome serial queue, every task i'll assign him will run one after the other

// concurent Queue: tasks run simultainaslly
// qos = quality of service = how important are the tasks in this queue

let concurrentQ = DispatchQueue(label: "MyConcernetQ", qos: usertInt, attributes: DispatchQueue.Attributes.concurrent)  // Attributes is enum so i could have just write .concurrent
